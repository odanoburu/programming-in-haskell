# programming in haskell

my solutions to the second edition of the book `programming in
haskell`, by Graham Hutton.

[[book page]](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html)

- most exercises are in the file `exercises.hs`, preceded by a comment
of the type `-- c[chapter number]e[exercise number]`.

- my setup is Emacs in `haskell-mode` + minor mode `hindent`.

- similar repos include:

    - by [@carlosgaldino](https://github.com/carlosgaldino/programming-in-haskell)
    
    - by [@myshov](https://github.com/myshov/programming_in_haskell)

**note**: some of these repos are for the first edition of the book,
you can see the first edition's webpage on
[archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20150920022947/http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/book.html).
