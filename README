# programming in haskell

my solutions to the book `programming in haskell`, by Graham Hutton.

[[book page]](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html)

- most exercises are in the file `exercises.hs`, preceded by a comment
of the type `-- c[chapter number]e[exercise number]`.

- my setup is Emacs in `haskell-mode` + minor mode `hindent`.
